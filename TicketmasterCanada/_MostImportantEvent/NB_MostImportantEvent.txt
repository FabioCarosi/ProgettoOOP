The BIG O was unmistakable with his trademark sunglasses, distinctive, powerful voice, complex compositions and dark emotional ballads. His impassioned voice coupled with his signature arrangements ensured the charting of the hits Only The Lonely, Crying, Oh, Pretty Woman, Dream Baby, Ooby Dooby, Blue Angel, Blue Bayou, You Got It and In Dreams. As a part of THE TRAVELING WILBURYS Orbison brought us End of the Line, Handle With Care and Youre Not Alone Anymore.The Everly Brothers charted 31 singles on the Hot 100, including 12 top 10 hits. Because their career predates the Hot 100s launch, some of their best-known hits arent on the list, including Bye Bye Love, Wake Up Little Susie, All I Have to Do Is Dream and their single biggest hit Cathys Clown.THE LONELY delivers a sensitive and dynamic tribute to the one and only Roy Orbison with hits of The Traveling Wilburys and The Everly Brothers plus other Classic Hits of the 50 and 60s. Veteran Mike Demers delivers a spot-on performance of Orbisons signature sound as he leads this group of musical journeymen in their mutual and deep appreciation of the timeless music of an era. THE LONELY approaches the music with a humble spirit and sincere desire to recreate the sounds and feel of the original recordings. The band has been selling out shows right from their debut. -30-"}]}
